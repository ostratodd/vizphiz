Huber Regressor:
For site 152 the bovine equivalent is 83 X [TMH 2]
For site 192 the bovine equivalent is 122 X [TMH 3]
For site 232 the bovine equivalent is 162 O [TMH 4] *** This seems interesting!
For site 378 the bovine equivalent is 292 X [TMH 7]

Light Gradient Boosting Machine:
For site 155 the bovine equivalent is 86 X [TMH 2]
For site 163 the bovine equivalent is 94 X [TMH 2]
For site 164 the bovine equivalent is 95 O [TMH2]
For site 378 the bovine equivalent is 292 X [TMH 7]

Random Forest Regressor:
For site 155 the bovine equivalent is 86 X [TMH 2]
For site 166 the bovine equivalent is 97 X [TMH 2]
For site 302 the bovine equivalent is 230 X [TMH 5]
For site 370 the bovine equivalent is 284 O [CLOSE! 285 is a known!] [Right next to TMH 7]

*For LWS/MWS S180A, H197Y, Y277F, T285A, A308S, and double mutations S180A/H197Y shift the max of the pigments by 7, 28, 8, 15, 27, and 11 nm, respectively.
Amino acid changes S180A (S-->A at site 180), H197Y, Y277F, T285A, and A308S are known to shift the maximum wavelength of absorption (lambda max) of red and green visual pigments toward blue, essentially in an additive fashion. 
Look at the homology model to see where these unknown sites are relative to eachother and the binding pocket.

* For SWS//UVS TM helices I-III - 46, 49, 52, 86, 90, 91, 93, 97, 109, 113, 114, 116, and 118
